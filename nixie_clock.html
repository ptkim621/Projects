        <h2>Nixie Tube Clock</h2>
        <p>I was interested in Nixie tubes for a while now and decided to start simple by building a clock using them. I wanted to learn more about electronics in the process and thought this would be a fun project to work on. I've documented all the issues I faced and hope this helps anyone interested in using Nixie tubes, building a similar project, or just learning something new!</p>
